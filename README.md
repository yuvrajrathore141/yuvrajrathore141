- 👋 Hi there! I'm [Your Name], a B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science and Engineering at VIT. My passion lies in coding and gaming, where I love diving into the intricacies of both to create and 
     understand new things.

- 🌱 As someone who is a bit introverted, it takes me some time to get comfortable with others, but once I do, I enjoy meaningful interactions and collaborations. When I'm not coding or gaming, you can find me 
     watching anime, appreciating beautiful sunsets, or exploring cityscapes.

- 🌏 I aspire to land a job at a top multinational company and explore the world, with Japan and England being high on my travel list. My goal is to harness my coding skills to create innovative and exciting 
     projects.

- 📚 On my GitHub, you'll find a variety of projects reflecting my journey and interests in technology. I'm always looking to learn more and contribute to the tech community.

- 🔍 You can find me on www.linkedin.com/in/yuvraj-singh-rathore-nov1411
